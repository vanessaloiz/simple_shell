## Description

Simple shell interprets and executes basic UNIX commands with arguments.
It is a project assigned with certain requirements and restrictions by Holberton School with the goal of recreating a UNIX shell.
The executable displays a prompt, waits for user input, interprets it and executes if it is valid.

##### Please follow the steps below to compile.
 1. `cd simple_shell`
 2. `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh`
 3. `./a.hsh`

### Examples

$ ls

This will list files in the current directory

$ ls -la

```
