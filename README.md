## Description

Simple shell interprets and executes basic UNIX commands with arguments. It is a project assigned with certain requirements and restrictions by Holberton School with the goal of recreating a UNIX shell.

 

The executable displays a prompt, waits for user input, interprets it and executes if it is valid.
